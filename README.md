*Description of Automated report generation*

This code creates a PDF report of student scores using pandas for data handling and FPDF for PDF generation. Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. First, it imports the necessary libraries: pandas for data manipulation and FPDF for PDF creation.

2. It creates a sample DataFrame with student names and scores.

3. It calculates summary statistics: average score, maximum score, minimum score, and identifies the top student.

4. It defines a custom PDFReport class that inherits from FPDF, with custom header and footer methods.

5. It creates a PDF document, adds content including the student data in a simple format and summary statistics.

6. Finally, it saves the PDF as "report.pdf" and prints a confirmation message.

The code demonstrates how to combine data analysis with PDF report generation to create a simple student score report.
